# Atlas Mission Contract

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-17
**Status:** Active

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE: Every Entity is Real and Distinct

**Atlas is the single source of truth for every real entity FFSC has ever interacted with:**

| Entity | What It Represents | Rule |
|--------|-------------------|------|
| **Person** | Every human who has requested help, brought cats to clinic, volunteered, or been contacted | Each person is a distinct record. Identity matching via email/phone, never by name alone. |
| **Place** | Every address where cats have been reported, trapped, or where an owner lives | Each physical location is distinct. Units in a complex are separate places linked via `parent_place_id`. |
| **Cat** | Every cat seen at clinic with a microchip, or documented in the field | Each cat is a distinct record identified by microchip (gold standard) or clinic Pet ID. |

### The Fundamental Promise

> **When you search an address in Atlas, you see ONLY data at that address.**
>
> - Cats linked to 101 Fisher Lane are cats that were actually AT 101 Fisher Lane
> - If it's a multi-unit complex, you see the building's units as children, each with their own data
> - Cats from other addresses that happened to merge administratively do NOT pollute this view

### Two Complementary Layers

**Layer 1: Clean Data Organization (Foundation)**
- Centralized `find_or_create_*` functions handle deduplication
- Identity resolution via email/phone (never name alone)
- Audit trail for all changes
- Places remain individualized - merging is cosmetic, not data-destructive

**Layer 2: Ecological Predictions (Computed)**
- Uses Layer 1 data PLUS qualitative sources (Google Maps, Project 75, surveys)
- Calculations happen in views, not stored on places
- Colony estimates in separate `place_colony_estimates` table
- Beacon will visualize these predictions on a map

### Why This Matters

The workflows (intake queue, trapping requests, clinic visits) are built on having historical context at the ready:
- "This address had 5 cats fixed in 2023, 3 more reported last month"
- "This person has called twice before about this location"
- "We've never serviced this area - it's new territory"

**If data is incorrectly consolidated, this context becomes meaningless.**

## Recent Updates (v1.3) - AI Enrichment Pipeline

### AI-Powered Data Enrichment - IMPLEMENTED (2026-01-17)

Automated data extraction using Claude AI to populate Beacon ecological data:

| Data Type | Source | Records Created | Script |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Birth Events | Lactating/pregnant appointments | 1,731 | `populate_birth_events_from_appointments.mjs` |
| Mortality Events | Clinic euthanasia notes | 37 | `populate_mortality_from_clinic.mjs` |
| Colony Estimates | Google Maps + Request notes | 1,238+ | `parse_quantitative_data.mjs` |
| Paraphrased Notes | Google Maps entries | 2,479 | `paraphrase_google_map_entries.mjs` |

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/cron/beacon-enrich` - Daily automated birth/mortality extraction
- `GET /api/admin/beacon/enrichment` - Pipeline status with by-source breakdowns

**Updated Stats APIs:**
- `/api/admin/beacon/reproduction/stats` - Now includes births by source/season
- `/api/admin/beacon/mortality/stats` - Now includes by_source breakdown

**AI Prompt Design:**
- Birth events: Estimates birth ~6 weeks before lactating appointment
- Mortality: Categorizes death cause (euthanasia, vehicle, predator, disease, unknown)
- Quantitative parser: Full TNR context for interpreting informal notes
- Paraphrasing: Light-touch cleanup, adds "[the client]" for clarity

---

## Recent Updates (v1.2)

### MIG_305: Preserve Original Cat Locations - APPLIED

Fixed issue where place merging caused cat counts to consolidate:
- Added `original_place_id` to `cat_place_relationships`
- Ecology views now use original location for cat counts
- Prevents "101 Fisher Lane has 100 cats" when those cats were actually at other addresses

### MIG_306: Immigration Tracking - APPLIED

Completes Beacon Gap #4 (Immigration vs Local Births):
- Added `arrival_type` enum: born_locally, likely_local_birth, immigrated, relocated, adopted_in, unknown
- Added `arrival_date` and `age_at_arrival_months` columns
- Created `infer_cat_arrival_type()` function
- Created `v_place_immigration_stats` view
- 7,715 cats classified as likely_local_birth, 12 as immigrated

### Observation Capture in Request Completion - IMPLEMENTED

When completing/partially completing a request, trappers can now log observations:
- `observation_cats_seen` - Total cats observed at site
- `observation_eartips_seen` - How many had ear tips
- Automatically creates `place_colony_estimates` record
- Enables Chapman estimator for the place

### Chapman Estimator Coverage - IMPROVED

Extended eartip observation window from 90 days to 365 days:
- **Before**: 17 places with mark_resight estimation
- **After**: 105 places with mark_resight estimation
- Project 75 survey data now contributes to Chapman coverage

## Purpose Statement

Atlas is the **operational data collection and management layer** for Forgotten Felines of Sonoma County's (FFSC) TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) program. Its primary mission is to collect, organize, and maintain the high-quality data that will power **Beacon** - FFSC's revolutionary predictive analytics system for strategic cat population management.

> "Data is useless if you can't make decisions with it. The power of Beacon is in allowing us to see patterns, forecast outcomes, and strategically target our resources."
> — Beacon Vision Statement

---

## Beacon Overview

### What is Beacon?

Beacon is a data-driven decision support system designed to transform FFSC from reactive TNR operations to **strategic population management**. Inspired by the Vortex simulation model (Boone et al. 2019), Beacon provides:

1. **TRACK** - Real-time visibility into colony populations across Sonoma County
2. **FORECAST** - Predictive modeling of population trends under different scenarios
3. **TARGET** - Strategic resource allocation to maximize population reduction

### Ground Truth Principle: FFSC Clinic Data

**FFSC is the ONLY dedicated spay/neuter clinic for community cats in Sonoma County.**

Other organizations may perform small quantities of TNR, but FFSC handles mass quantities (4,000+ cats/year). This means:

| Metric | Source | Reliability |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cats altered at a location | FFSC ClinicHQ data | **100% verified** |
| External alterations | Other orgs | **~2% (negligible)** |
| Ear-tipped cats observed | Trapper observations | Field estimate |
| Colony size | Surveys, intake forms | Variable confidence |

**Implication:** When calculating alteration rates:
```
Alteration Rate = FFSC_altered / Population_estimate
```
We do NOT need to guess at external alterations - FFSC clinic records ARE the ground truth.

### Scientific Foundation: Vortex Model (Boone et al. 2019)

The Beacon approach is grounded in peer-reviewed research on cat population dynamics.

#### Key Equations

**1. Chapman Mark-Recapture Estimator (Population Size)**
```
N̂ = ((M + 1)(C + 1) / (R + 1)) - 1

Where:
  N̂ = Estimated population
  M = Marked cats (FFSC verified alterations - ground truth)
  C = Total cats observed in sample
  R = Recaptured marked (ear-tipped cats observed)
```

**2. Alteration Rate**
```
p = A / N

Where:
  p = Alteration rate (proportion fixed)
  A = Cats altered by FFSC (verified clinic records)
  N = Estimated population
```

**3. Population Growth Model**
```
N(t+1) = N(t) + Births - Deaths + Immigration - Emigration

Births = F_intact × litters_per_year × kittens_per_litter × survival

Where:
  F_intact = Females × (1 - alteration_rate) × 0.5
  survival = density-dependent (25-50% based on population density)
```

**4. Density-Dependent Kitten Survival**
```
S_kitten = S_max - (S_max - S_min) × (N / K)

Where:
  S_max = 50% survival at low density
  S_min = 25% survival at high density
  N = Current population
  K = Carrying capacity
```

**5. Time to Colony Completion**
```
T = (N × (1 - p)) / (TNR_rate × capacity_per_cycle)

Where:
  T = Estimated 6-month cycles to completion
  N = Current population
  p = Current alteration rate
  TNR_rate = Target intensity (0.75 for high-intensity)
```

#### Configurable Parameters (Admin Panel)

All parameters are configurable via `/admin/ecology-config` with scientific defaults:

| Parameter | Default | Range | Source |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Reproduction** ||||
| Litters/year | 1.8 | 1.0-3.0 | Boone 2019 |
| Kittens/litter | 4 | 2-6 | Veterinary literature |
| Breeding season | Feb-Nov | - | California climate |
| Female maturity | 6 mo | 4-12 | Veterinary consensus |
| Male maturity | 8 mo | 6-15 | Veterinary consensus |
| **Survival** ||||
| Kitten survival (low density) | 50% | 25-90% | Boone 2019 |
| Kitten survival (high density) | 25% | 10-50% | Boone 2019 |
| Adult survival (annual) | 70% | 50-90% | Boone 2019 |
| Cat lifespan | 15 yr | 5-20 | MIG_220 default |
| **TNR Intensity** ||||
| High-intensity threshold | 75% | 50-95% | Boone 2019 |
| Low-intensity threshold | 50% | 30-70% | Boone 2019 |
| Time step | 6 mo | 3-12 | Vortex model |
| **Immigration** ||||
| Low immigration rate | 0.5 cats/6mo | 0-2 | Boone 2019 |
| High immigration rate | 2.0 cats/6mo | 0.5-5 | Boone 2019 |
| Default rate | 1.0 cats/6mo | 0.5-2 | Midpoint |
| **FFSC-Specific** ||||
| FFSC is primary clinic | Yes | - | Operational reality |
| External alteration rate | 2% | 0-20% | Estimate |

**Critical Finding from Research:**
- High-intensity TNR (75% of intact cats per 6-month cycle) can reduce populations by 70% in 6 years
- Low-intensity TNR (50%) leads to minimal reduction
- Without immigration control, even 75% TNR only reduces by 50%

## Atlas Operational Workflows

Beyond Beacon data collection, Atlas manages FFSC's operational workflows:

### Intake Queue Management (MIG_294)

**Unified submission status workflow:**
```
new → in_progress → scheduled → complete
                 ↘ archived
```

**Features:**
- Single `submission_status` field (replacing 3+ legacy fields)
- Priority override with auto-triage score
- Communication log via journal system
- All submitted answers editable with audit trail

### Trapper Onboarding Pipeline (MIG_298)

**Status flow:**
```
interested → contacted → orientation_complete →
training_complete → contract_sent → contract_signed → approved
```

**Tables:**
- `trapper_onboarding` - Tracks pipeline progress with milestone dates
- `person_roles` - Final trapper status after approval

**Functions:**
- `create_trapper_interest()` - New interest with deduplication
- `advance_trapper_onboarding()` - Move through pipeline stages

### Out-of-County Automation (MIG_299)

**Automated response for non-Sonoma County requests:**
- `is_out_of_county` flag on submissions
- `email_templates` table for customizable messages
- `sent_emails` log for audit trail
- `v_pending_out_of_county_emails` view for queue

**Requires:** Email provider integration (Resend) - pending setup

### Entity Auto-Linking (MIG_295)

**Periodic cron job links:**
- Cats to places via appointment owner contact info
- Appointments to trappers via email/phone matching
- Intake submissions to places via geocoding
- Requesters to their places

**Cron endpoint:** `/api/cron/entity-linking` (runs daily at 7:30 AM)

### Centralized Request Creation (MIG_297)

**Function:** `find_or_create_request()`

All request creation must go through this function:
- Deduplicates by `source_system` + `source_record_id`
- Auto-creates places from raw addresses
- Auto-creates people from contact info
- Proper audit logging to `entity_edits`

---

## Atlas Architecture Principles

```

### Centralized Functions (MANDATORY)

**NEVER create entities directly. Always use these functions:**

| Entity | Function | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Person | `find_or_create_person(email, phone, first, last, addr, source)` | Identity matching, deduplication, merge chain |
| Place | `find_or_create_place_deduped(address, name, lat, lng, source)` | Address normalization, geocoding queue |
| Cat | `find_or_create_cat_by_microchip(chip, name, sex, ...)` | Microchip is gold standard, enriches existing |
| Request | `find_or_create_request(source, record_id, ...)` (MIG_297) | Auto-creates people/places, audit trail |
| Trapper Interest | `create_trapper_interest(first, last, email, ...)` (MIG_298) | Uses find_or_create_person, creates onboarding |

### Source System Values

Use **exactly** these values for `source_system`:
- `'airtable'` - All Airtable data (legacy, not 'airtable_staff' or variants)
- `'clinichq'` - All ClinicHQ clinic data
- `'web_intake'` - Web intake form submissions
- `'atlas_ui'` - Manual staff entry via Atlas UI

---

## Current Capabilities for Beacon

### Colony Size Estimation (READY)

**Table:** `trapper.place_colony_estimates`

Multiple data sources feed colony estimates with weighted confidence:

| Source Type | Base Confidence | Description |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| `verified_cats` | 100% | Ground truth from clinic records |
| `post_clinic_survey` | 85% | Project 75 post-clinic surveys |
| `trapper_site_visit` | 80% | Trapper field observations |
| `trapping_request` | 60% | Request-based estimates |
| `intake_form` | 55% | Intake form self-reports |
| `internal_notes_parse` | 40% | Extracted from notes |
| `legacy_mymaps` | 50% | Historical KML data |

**View:** `v_place_colony_status` aggregates with recency-weighted confidence.

### Alteration Rate Calculation (READY)

**View:** `v_place_ecology_stats`

Implements Chapman mark-recapture estimator:
```
N̂ = ((M+1)(C+1)/(R+1)) - 1

Where:
  M = Marked cats (altered at clinic - verified ground truth)
  C = Total cats observed at site
  R = Ear-tipped cats observed at site
```

Provides:
- `a_known` - Verified altered cats (from clinic data)
- `n_hat_chapman` - Population estimate when observation data available
- `p_hat_chapman_pct` - Alteration percentage
- `estimated_work_remaining` - Cats still needing TNR

**Critical Gap:** Only 422 places have observation data for Chapman. 7,000+ rely on lower-bound estimates.

### Cat Movement Tracking (READY)

**Table:** `trapper.cat_movement_events`

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `from_place_id` | Origin location |
| `to_place_id` | Destination location |
| `movement_type` | relocation, escape, migration, adoption |
| `recorded_at` | When movement occurred |

**View:** `v_cat_movement_patterns` classifies cats as:
- `stationary` - Single location
- `roamer` - 2-3 locations
- `mobile` - 4+ locations

### Multi-Parcel Site Aggregation (READY)

**Table:** `trapper.place_place_edges`

Links related addresses (e.g., dairy farms with multiple parcels):
- `same_colony_site` - Single colony spanning addresses
- `adjacent_to` - Nearby locations
- `nearby_cluster` - Geographic grouping

**View:** `v_site_aggregate_stats` de-duplicates cats across linked sites.

### Attribution Windows (READY)

**View:** `v_request_alteration_stats`

Rolling attribution windows for TNR counting:
- Legacy (before May 2025): Fixed ±6 months from `source_created_at`
- Active requests: Rolling NOW() + 6 months
- Resolved requests: 3 months after `resolved_at`

---

## Beacon Data Gaps - Status

### ✅ Gap 1: Kitten Birth Tracking - IMPLEMENTED (MIG_289)

**Table:** `trapper.cat_birth_events`

Tracks kitten births with:
- `litter_id` - Groups siblings
- `mother_cat_id` - Links to mother
- `birth_date` + `birth_date_precision` - Flexible dating
- `place_id` - Location of birth
- `kitten_count_in_litter`, `survived_to_weaning` - Litter outcomes

**Beacon Value:** Enables birth rate modeling for population growth forecasting.

### ✅ Gap 2: Mortality Tracking - IMPLEMENTED (MIG_290)

**Table:** `trapper.cat_mortality_events`

Tracks cat deaths with:
- `death_date`, `death_cause` - When and why

- `place_id` - Location for geographic mortality patterns

**Beacon Value:** Completes population equation (births - deaths + immigration).

### ✅ Gap 3: Seasonal Breeding Patterns - IMPLEMENTED (MIG_291)

**View:** `trapper.v_seasonal_breeding_patterns`

Analyzes from appointment data:
- Monthly kitten counts and pregnancy rates
- "Kitten season" flagging (Feb-Oct in California)
- Year-over-year trend comparisons

**Beacon Value:** Enables proactive resource planning for kitten surges.

### ✅ Gap 4: Colony Immigration vs Local Births - COMPLETE (MIG_306)

**Implemented:**
- `arrival_type` enum on `cat_place_relationships`: born_locally, likely_local_birth, immigrated, relocated, adopted_in, unknown
- `arrival_date` and `age_at_arrival_months` columns
- `infer_cat_arrival_type()` function for automatic classification
- `v_place_immigration_stats` view for per-place analysis
- 7,715 cats classified as likely_local_birth, 12 as immigrated

**Beacon Value:** Enables immigration rate modeling per Vortex specifications
